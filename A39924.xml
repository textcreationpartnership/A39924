            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>SIR, I blesse God, my last Discourse with you, about the <hi>Practical use of Infant-Baptism,</hi> so Baptised me into your Principles, that (as to the main of your Discourse) I am not (by any thing which either mine own thoughts, or the Objections of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103490:4"/> others, to whom I have Communicated it, have suggested to me) any whit stumbled therein And therefore I desire you will not Interpret my present <hi>Second</hi> addresse to you, as an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my unsettlednesse in the Point then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der debate; but only, as an expression of my farther desire, to have my understanding cleared in some passages, then delivered by you; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, I have met with some dispute from others and find some darknesse of apprehension in my self: And withal to give you the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of confirming me in my present perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by the addition of such new considerations, as possibly our farther Discourse may give you occasion of dilating your thoughts into. And therefore, I shall only take upon me the Person of another therein, and Suggest to you, as well as I can, what Questions, and Objections I think a Christian of the growth in which your last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course found me, would exercise you withall, or understand others are dissatisfied in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Paed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptista.</speaker>
               <p>I assure you, <hi>Neighbour,</hi> you cannot more blesse God for the satisfaction, that slender dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course then gave you, then I desire to do; for that God made use of me as an happy Instrument to give it you. And I farther assure you, that your present visit is so much the more welcome to me, because it brings me the good news, that you are (without <hi>Dipping)</hi> of <hi>Asterictus,</hi> become <hi>Sterictus,</hi> of an unsetled Christian in this point, a setled, and confirmed one. But seeing you will yet passe under your old name, acting <hi>Asterictus</hi> still, when you are another man. I shall not mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake you for the party you resolve but to Perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103490:4"/> Only, I must warn you of one thing, that you will not (out of charity to your new per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion) put forth lesse strength of opposition, or take easier satisfaction, in any thing in Dispute between us, then if you were really Mr. <hi>Asteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus</hi> still.</p>

               <p>I am very well pleased, <hi>Sir,</hi> that my <hi>change</hi> yields you so much <hi>content,</hi> and my <hi>name</hi> so much <hi>mirth.</hi> And, (as to your Caution,) I shall assure you to do my best to find you more work; and I hope, God will effectually carry you through it, to do it to the purpose. And to encourage you therein, I assure you, upon mine own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that I am not the only man, upon whom your last Discourse hath had this effect: but some others, who were serious in their dissatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as I was, have, by the blessing of God, been reduced to the Practice of Infant-baptism, which they formerly forbare, as I did, because they knew not how to practice aright.</p>

               <p>I scarce dare to hope, <hi>Neighbour,</hi> that any of my poor labours should return into my bosome, with so ample a reward, as the Reduction of any one straying Sheep, into the Fold of my Master, when I first bestowed that pains upon you. And when I saw what effect it had in your particular, I thought my self sufficiently apaid, in your sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction And therefore (considering mine own slendernesse, which I my self best know) I should very much suspect the truth of this farther Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, but that the experience I have of you Piety, assures me that you dare not lie, for <hi>God glory,</hi> much lesse for <hi>my encouragement.</hi> How<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>First,</hi> then, <hi>Sir,</hi> Although you led me into the understanding of many pretious truths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the way of improving Infant-Baptisme practically, yet I remember you omitted one (and that a Principall) use of Baptism, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Administration at the yeares of Discretion,</hi> seemes to have the advantage of <hi>Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme,</hi> viz. <hi>[in the Assurance of Remission of sins:]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> you Suggest <hi>another,</hi> which to some, (and those, sober men) seems dubious; <note place="margin">pag. 5.</note>
                  <hi>viz. [the probability of conveighing actual Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification, and Regeneration unto some Infants in the very Administration.]</hi> In both which parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, I desire to be farther instructed by you, at our entrance. Some other things I shall sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:103490:5"/> to you, when these are dispatched.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>It is true, as to the <hi>former</hi> of these particulars, our former discourse was deficient, and the <hi>later</hi> was not so fully delivered, as to remove all scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; And therefore I thank you, that you put me in mind of them, and (upon the account of that courtesie) I shall endeavour to give you as ample satisfaction in them as I may.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> therefore, I acknowledg <hi>Remission of sins,</hi> a special part of the Spiritual grace sealed in Baptism. And I <hi>withall</hi> suppose, that I can prove, (contrary to what you say) <hi>That in the sealing of this mercy, Infant-Baptism, hath the advantage of Baptism at riper years,</hi> as well as in the other particulars, insisted upon in our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer discourse. But, suppose I could not; it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> I prove it <hi>no lesse useful.</hi> For supposing the balance weigh but even in this particular, yet it will follow, <hi>that no man need remove his Baptism at years of discretion, for a benefit which Infant-Baptism</hi> as fully <hi>exhibited,</hi> as <hi>Baptism at those years can do.</hi> Now this <hi>later</hi> I will undertake in the <hi>first</hi> place; and afterwards descend to offer you a consideration or two, to clear the proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> (at least) of my <hi>first</hi> proposition. Onely, (fororders sake) I must intreate you to acquaint me vherein you conceive the advantage to lie on your side in this particular, and I doubt not to shew you your mistake therein.</p>

               <p>In his, Sir, that the <hi>present</hi> application of the Sacramental Element, to an understanding per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, is a <hi>present actual assurance</hi> of the Grace sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:103490:6"/> which to an Infant incapable of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannot be so: and the looking back to the baptisme received in Infancy, at yeares of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, receives much disadvantage in point of the livelinesse of application, by the distance of time betweene the Ordinance, and the use thus made of it.</p>

               <p>By consequence therefore, Baptisme admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred at Infant-age, may at after-yeares, yield its vertue and efficacy as well, (possibly as early to <hi>one</hi> then baptized, as baptisme at yeares of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to <hi>another</hi> to whom then it is administred: seeing God is not bound to make the Ordinance efficacious at the precise time of administration, either to the one, or to the other.</p>

                  <hi>God</hi> cooperating with it? Or, is it from the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding application</hi> of the things signified in, and with the signe, also?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aster.</speaker>
               <p>Surely, from <hi>both</hi> together.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>Then surely, Infant-Baptisme, acted over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon <hi>another</hi> in my presence, may doe no lesse in this kind, then if it were then, and there administred to <hi>mee</hi> in mine owne person. For surely, the morall application of the signes may bee actually, and as effectually made by an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing Christian, putting himselfe in the place of another to whom it is applied, as if hee were the very subject of that application. Tis but the annexing of this short meditation, to what is then said and done.</p>
               <p>—<hi>Mutato nomine de me,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was once done to me, which is now acted on the person of that Infant; God speakes that to me now in his person, what hee spake to me then in mine owne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>concurrence of the Spirit,</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose you allow him to be a free agent, that like <hi>the wind, blowes when, and where he listeth,</hi> and therefore, by the after-meditation of Baptisme received in Infancy, upon such an occasion, it is as possible, I may receive this Assurance by his concurrence, as if I my selfe were then, and there the subject of the Administration.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aster.</speaker>
               <p>But however, <hi>Sir,</hi> the <hi>second</hi> ground before mentioned may turne the scales on the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists side in this particular. For surely, though it should be true, that the sealing vertue of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptisme may be received, as truely many yeares after, as that of Baptisme at yeares, in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:103490:7"/> the moment of administration: yet, that seal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing efficacy is more strong and powerfull, under a present application, then afterwards.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>I told you also before, that this <hi>second ground</hi> would admit of as much dispute, as the former. For if the assurance be given, by the same spirit, at the one or other season, it is stronger or weaker according to the greater or lesser measure of cooperating influence from that spirit. But it may be you will abstract the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the <hi>supernaturall Agent,</hi> in this case, and looke onely, to the effect, as it depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an applicatory use of the administration it selfe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aster.</speaker>
               <p>You rightly ghesse, <hi>Sir,</hi> and I cannot in that particular, so soone let goe my hold of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, when I consider, that in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration of the other Sacrament, we choose rather to receive the Elements with their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application in the Sacramentall words, <hi>our selves,</hi> then to stand and looke on whiles they are administred to <hi>others;</hi> and I conceive upon the <hi>some</hi> ground: because therein wee apprehend a more direct, immediate, and particular obsig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the benefits sealed, and so suppose it to be more morally operative of the assurance therein exhibited. Now in this case, there seemes to be <hi>par ratio,</hi> a like reason in both Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>Suppose it, yet it will only hold the same, when the persons are alike considered, in both Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which I conceive, is not done, as you lay the case. The person, I suppose, making his advantage of Baptisme administred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:103490:8"/> is one, who hath received it himselfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so. The person you suppose, making advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Lords Supper administred to another, is a bare Spectator, not having communicated therein himselfe also: and so the case is not the same, as to the <hi>persons,</hi> though, as to the <hi>Sacraments</hi> it may be. Lay the case then, thus. A man that hath, it may be, received the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Elements of the Lords Supper, himselfe, is withall present at the administration of it to others. And I would faine know, whether he may not draw as effectuall an assurance from it as so administred, putting himselfe by applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory meditation, in the case of every other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular receiver, as he did er might, when he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe was the particular subject of the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? For my part, I judge he may. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, when any particular persons have received the Elements themselves, I know not why they should think themselves obliged (as to their owne benefit) to continue their presence at the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration thereof to others: but (as beggars at a dole) when they are served, depart, not mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all what others receive.</p>
               <p>But, suppose your case were right laid, yet I am not of the mind, but that the consideration of the very circumstance of <hi>Infant administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> in the case of Baptisme, is of speciall efficacy to promote Assurance of my particular remission, when by occasion of the same administration up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>others,</hi> I am led to an application of what was done to <hi>my selfe;</hi> nor lesse then actuall Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme would be, if I were the present subject of that administration, at yeares of capacity. For
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:103490:8"/> mee thinkes, I could thus, upon such an occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, plead it out with God, and in pleading, worke it upon my selfe. <hi>Lord, I am in this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration minded of an Act of Oblivion long since sealed to me when I was in the same capacity with yonder Infant. I have often pleaded it, (thou knowest) at thy Throne of grace; and beene as often tempted to doubt whether my plea were admitted or no. Sometimes, the greatnesse of my sinnes, sometimes the weakenesse of my faith, the defects of my repentance, the faintnesse and flatnesse of my prayers, and (in all of these and many particulars more) the unworthynesse of my person, have discouraged me. But Lord, am I now more unworthy to receive the mercies them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, then I was at that time to receive the seale of them? Surely thou didst then seale free pardon to me, when I could not in the largest charity, be supposed to have any thing of personall worth, to plead for it. I desire now no other pardon then what thou sealedst then. What I was</hi> necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>voyd of then, I now strip my selfe of</hi> volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily. <hi>And shall I be lesse favourably enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by thee, because I now see, confesse, be waile mine owne unworthynesse, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the same then, but unseene, unconfessed, and unbewailed? Surely thou that blottest out transgressions for thine owne names sake, canst not lesse glorifie thy Name, by pardoning a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, confessing sinner, when out of his owne mouth thou might'st condemne him, then by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the same pardon, to a sinner, that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an heart to repent, and a mouth to confesse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus you see how I could improve the Infant-administration
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103490:9"/> of Baptisme, to strengthen Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of remission of sins, many years after.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aster.</speaker>
               <p>Yea but <hi>Sir,</hi> Infant Baptisme at most can onely give the Assurance of the remission of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall sin,</hi> seeing the party to whom it was then sealed, could be capable of no other; so that either Baptisme here by, must be confined to that <hi>only,</hi> in its sealing act; or else, if it be also a seale of the remission of <hi>actuall sins,</hi> it will need a second administration applicable to persons, when they have superadded the guilt of them also.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>Neither your <hi>dilemma,</hi> nor the <hi>ground</hi> of it, <hi>neighbour,</hi> offers any violence to the doctrine before delivered; For (as to the <hi>ground)</hi> it will not follow from the incapacity of <hi>actuall</hi> guilt in the subject of Infant-Baptisme, that God seals only to such a subject the pardon of <hi>originall</hi> sin. Indeed, <hi>[as Infant-Baptism]</hi> it most prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily and properly respects <hi>originall</hi> sin, the sin of the party to whom it is then administred. But <hi>[as Baptism]</hi> I know not what hinders, but that God may also beforehand extend that seale to the pardon of <hi>actuall</hi> sin, to them who after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards should commit it. I am assured <hi>circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> was not only the seale of remission of sins to those who needed it only for the pardon of <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall</hi> guilt, but also to those who afterwards contracted the guilt of <hi>actuall</hi> sins. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells us it was <hi>a seale of the righteousnesse of</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 4. 11.</note>
                  <hi>faith;</hi> and so sealed righteousnesse to those who were capable of applying it by faith (who were <hi>actuall</hi> sinners) as well as to those whose age rendred them uncapable of <hi>actuall</hi> believing.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103490:9"/> And indeed to set forth the rich grace of God in pardoning, and the compleate efficacy of Christs satisfaction, in procuring the pardon of sin, it was very much conducible to Gods glory in both; to seale pardon of <hi>actuall</hi> sin before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of it, though not to apply it <hi>actually,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commission and repentance. For so, in sealing to man in his Infant Age, the pardon of those sins which afterwards he should commit, God doth in effect tell him, (and that roundly and fully) that the Originall spring of pardoning and reconciling grace, is in himselfe, who <hi>found a ransome</hi> before we sought it, that he is the first <note place="margin">Job 33. 24</note> in that work, seeing he prevents the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of, and much more, the repentance for our sins, by bringing us under a gracious sealed Covenant of pardon, before capacity of actuall guilt. Nor doth he herein, lesse clearly and fully speake out the compleatnesse of the efficacy of Christs blood sealed in Baptisme, by letting us know, that our God before hand accepted that-attonement for us, which in time he applies to us; and the savour of Christ propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, hath ascended into his nosthrils, and hath virtually attoned him to us, before the blood of the Covenant runs forth upon us in the Order of gospel-application, to our actuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.</p>
               <p>And hereby you may see also <hi>one</hi> horn of your <hi>lilemma</hi> sawed off, seeing I do not confine the efficacy of Baptisme, though administred in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, to <hi>Originall sin</hi> onely.</p>
               <p>And as for the <hi>other;</hi> it being cleared in the former discourse, that a seale of forgivenesse,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103490:10"/> even of actuall sin, may (without absurdity) be said to be administred before it can be actually applied by the receiver; there will no necessity appear of administring it a second time, at years of capacity for actuall application: because the vertue of that which was before received, extends it selfe through the whole course of a mans life afterwards, and is as often applicable, as he commits, and repents of actuall sin. And if it were but so, yet there is another Sacrament, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to be received, which would abundantly supply the defect of this, seeing it seales the same grace, <hi>remission of sins</hi> in the blood of Christ.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Sir,</hi> I must confesse my selfe much obliged to you for your copious enlargement upon this head, wherein I suppose it convenient both for your selfe, and me, to pauze a while. <hi>For your selfe,</hi> because I doubt, you may be tired, by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in my weake and prolix reasoning: and <hi>for me,</hi> because I have nothing of moment to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply at present that may deserve your farther stay thereon. Especially, when I consider, that you and I may, by Gods providence, meete again, and so I shall have other opportunities of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving farther satisfaction from you hereafter, if up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on farther thoughts, I shall see need to require it: wherefore, I shall presume, (if you please) to demand those considerations in the next place from you, which you promised, to conclude it probable at least, <hi>that (in</hi> this point of promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Assurance of remission</hi> of sins) <hi>Infant Baptisme,</hi> hath the advantage of <hi>Baptisme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred at riper years.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>I remember, that I lie under such an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:103490:10"/> and I know no reason you have to account it any presumption in you, to sue a confessed debt. In a few words therefore, I shall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour satisfaction both to it, and you.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> therefore, to me it seems probable (at least) that to the assurance of pardon on Gods part, (for Sacraments assure no otherwise, then by signifying and ratifying the grace of God in the pardon of sins, they doe not assure, or seale, any qualifications for pardon) those evidences that lead most to the consideration of grace as most <hi>free,</hi> are most effectuall. Now that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptisme doth so, rather then Baptisme at yeares of discretion, I have already showne in part, and shall more fully cleare anon.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It seemes to me no lesse probable, that that evidence of pardoning grace which most abstracts from the consideration, of any <hi>difference betweene sinnes,</hi> from any imaginable aggravations, is likely to be most effectually assuring. Now the evidence drawne from the sealing of remission in Baptisme administred in Infancy, is upon a peculiar account, such. A pardon sealed, before a capacity of <hi>actuall sin,</hi> which (in the aggravating circumstances thereof) puts the only difference between sinner and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; gives equall hopes, and encouragements to all sinners, and so is alike applicable to every ones conscience, to whome it is so sealed, being laid hold on by faith. Now although the same grace, and that in the same latitude, bee sealed in Baptisme at age, yet that latitude is not alike visibly held forth in the Administration of the Seale at that age. So that however the like
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103490:11"/> grounds of Assurance bee derivable from the <hi>Covenant,</hi> at any-Age, yet in the <hi>sealing of that Covenant</hi> at Infant-Age, the advantage appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently lyes, as to that helpe, which the seale (as distinct from the Covenant) doth afford toward it. Possibly, this may bee plainer to you, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplified in the person of a Christian, gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Assurance thus. <hi>Soule, why art thon thus cast downe, and why art thou disquieted within me?

For (although the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of those passages be somewhat eccentricall to my maine discourse in that book, and I expresse it only dubiously, as not finding so sure a footing as I could desire in so dark a point; and the <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> be a phrase that I lay no great weight upon; so that it doth not much concerne me whether they be owned or disowned; yet) I shall be so tender of any sober mens satisfaction, that I shall not willingly leave you or them scrupled in any word that drops from my tongue or pen, as far as I can prevent it. When therefore I hinted to you the <hi>probablenesse of a possibility</hi> (for that is the highest pin that I dared reach to in this point) <hi>that justifying and sanctifying grace, may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon some Infants in Baptisme:</hi> I did it upon these grounds, and considerations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That <hi>just<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fication</hi> and <hi>sanctification</hi> are the principall graces that baptisme seales on Gods part; all other mercyes and favours depending upon them, which, in the former branch, viz.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:103490:12"/>
                  <hi>Justifying grace,</hi> I suppose none ever called in Question: and as to the later, <hi>sanctifying grace,</hi> I shall endeavour to cleare anon, in case any should doubt of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That it is generally agreed by our Divines that the Sacraments are not <hi>nuda signa,</hi> bare <hi>signes</hi> of the grace they signify. The generall signification of the word <hi>seale,</hi> applied by the Apostle, Rom. 4. 11. to circumcision, suting unto every Ordinance of the same generall nature with it; we have learned to call all Sacraments (being such in that generall) <hi>seales of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</hi> Now a <hi>seale,</hi> doth not only <hi>rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy</hi> a deed, but also <hi>legally conveigh,</hi> by that rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, a present <hi>right</hi> from party to party. In the case in question, the deed or writing is the <hi>Covenant of grace,</hi> the seale is <hi>baptisme.</hi> This seale therefore according to the nature of a seale, doth both <hi>ratify</hi> Gods Covenant, and <hi>conveigh</hi> a right to the benefits of that Covenant, to the persons to whom it is administred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. (Because in this Covenant the persons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed are of severall capacities,) for in adult or growne persons justification coms to be bestowed upon believing; and sanctification, in the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon the outward and ordinary meanes of working it, but infants can neither believe nor use the meanes in which faith is wrought (therefore) I suppose I had cause to conclude, that God justifies them upon <hi>another account<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and sanctifies them in <hi>another way,</hi> then those that are of age. And (by consequence) that baptisme now (as circumcision of old) seales and conveighs to them, these graces, according to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103490:13"/> the same difference. And in this particular, I shall tell you by the way, what a godly and learned minister writes to me. <hi>As in the bodily life</hi> (saith he) <hi>one organ is the instrument of nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment to the Child in the womb, another when horne: so in the conveighance of spirituall life, 'tis one way to a Child, another to one of yeares. For this is not the most universal proposi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion of the Gospell,</hi> [He that beleeveth shall be saved:] <hi>but this,</hi> He that hath the Son hath life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not life.] <hi>Now God gives his Son by the Spirit, and we receive him by faith: but God can supply the want of that hand in a Child, by dropping into his mouth what he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive with his hand, as I may so say.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. (Because we have no clear light to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the exact season of Gods bestowing these graces on Infants; and they are alike capable of them at all times after the Covenant takes hold of them) I propounded it as not impossible nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that in that Ordinance which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veighs a <hi>legall right to them,</hi> God may put them in <hi>possession of them.</hi> I doe not say, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not or doth not bestow them on those that dye unbaptized; nor that God hath <hi>appointed that Ordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ance for that purpose</hi> (at least, so as we may lay any stresse of faith upon it, certainly to expect it therein:) but only that there seemes to be a probability, that God (who useth to convey grace by Ordinances, where he affords opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and capacity to enjoy them) may in Baptism (the only Ordinance that Infants come under) bestow on them the pardon of sin, and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="25" facs="tcp:103490:13"/>5. (Because we have no ground to extend this Charity to <hi>all Infants;</hi> no nor to <hi>all Infants of believing parents,</hi> divers of whom, it appears, may live, and dye unjustified and unsanctified; therefore) I farther advanced, to limit my Charity in this particular. And to this purpose, considering that Election is, confessedly, the immutable rule according to which God justifies, and sanctifies, I was cautious of extending (with D<seg rend="sup">r.</seg>
                  <hi>Ward,</hi> and others) the <hi>skirt</hi> of justifying, and the <hi>seed</hi> of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying grace to any non-elected. For I was not, nor am I satisfied, that the Justification, or sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Infants, is of <hi>another nature,</hi> then the justification▪ and sanctification of grown persons, though bestowed in <hi>another way.</hi> I know no <hi>justification,</hi> but that which consists in the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sins, and acceptation of our persons, through the imputation of Christs righteousnesse;</hi> nor <hi>sanctification,</hi> but that <hi>participation of the devine nature,</hi> that <hi>seed of God,</hi> of which Peter and John speake; and therefore I cannot extend justification and sanctification to all infants vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly under the Covenant, or upon that account baptized, because I am perswaded it cannot be done, without suppositon of <hi>falling away</hi> from saving grace; seeing many such fall away, and perish everlastingly. And here also I shall once more quote the words of the same <hi>reverend man</hi> in the same Letter. I <hi>conceive</hi> (saith he, being by me asked his judgment in this point) <hi>Change of Covenant, and change of Image are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And that Baptisme seales that Interest which men have before they are baptized, nay before they are borne; Look how they are written</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:103490:14"/>
                  <hi>in the records of eternity, (Elect, or non-Elect) so it seales, as also doth the other Sacrament; a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible right by vertue of their visible Interest, an invisible right, by vertue of their invisible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, if any such they have at all, which God only knoweth,</hi> &amp; de secretis non judicat Ecclesia, <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret things belong to God, but things revealed to us and our Children.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. (Because, of <hi>Elect</hi> Infants, <hi>some</hi> die in infancy, and <hi>others</hi> live to yeares of discretion) I knew no reason to conclude, that God would break his owne <hi>Ordinary rode</hi> of bestowing these graces in Infant Age, upon those that live to the use of means appointed to that end. And I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose (excepting the case of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> who yet may be looked on, as so privileged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an extraordinary account, <hi>to wit,</hi> that by a miraculous instinct, he might beare witnesse to Christ, as his <hi>forerunner</hi> in the <hi>wombe,</hi> as well as in the <hi>wildernesse)</hi> it can hardly be asserted <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nay, it were against the very end for which God appoints the use of <hi>means:</hi> seeing by bestowing saving grace out of them to those who live to enjoy them; God would in a sort make voyd his owne Institutions. For what need of them when the ends of them may be otherwise attained? I confesse, grace is wrought in some very early, possibly in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, but ordinarily, 'tis after they come under catechizing.</p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:103490:14"/>
               <p>Upon these considerations therefore, I made bold to adde another limit to my probable asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to wit, their <hi>not surviving an Infant-age:</hi> or (as I there expresse my selfe) <hi>that such as (being Elected) dye in Infancy,</hi> are onely the subjects of this my Charity.</p>
               <p>And herein I having asked the advice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>godly and reverend minister,</hi> as most in this nation, he returnes me this Answer, <hi>As to that particular concerning Elect Infants that dye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore actuall faith, I doe altogether concurre with you, and I have the consent of two able Divines whom I consulted of late, the rather, that you might be the better perswaded and encouraged to adhere to that opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I know no reason why any one should be offended at me for a proposition so warily laid downe, and that under the favour of so many received Orthodox principles.</p>

               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> I have heard it objected against this doctrine, that hereby you give no more ground of hope to parents, of their Childrens salvation, then the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> give, or then we may have of Heathens Children; seeing the <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> supposeth Infants may be justified, and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified <hi>according to the Election,</hi> as well as you. And the Children of <hi>Heathens</hi> may (for any thing we know) be <hi>elected,</hi> as well as ours.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>Both these objections, (I conceive) doe not prejudice my opinion at all. For <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabaptist</hi> ownes <hi>Election,</hi> but doth not owne the <hi>Covenant.</hi> And so he hath (according to his principles) no speciall ground to derive his hopes of Election with relation to Children,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:103490:15"/> downe to the case of this or that particular. But we that owne the Covenant of God to us, and all our seed, can say upon good grounds, we are perswaded of the Election, and salvation of such and such a Child dying in Infancy, because a visible standing under the Covenant of grace to any particular person, who by any declared for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture hath not justly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut himselfe off therefrom, gives sufficient grounds of Charity to judge that such an one is Elected, and shall be saved; Though some of them may be neither. For it followes not, that because we assert a Charity grounded on a probability of Election, and sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to our Infants as our Infants, from their Interest in the Covenant; that therefore we must inferre a necessity of an actuall donation of all the blessings held forth in the Covenant, to all of them. Because a visible standing in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant binds me to extend the same Charity to hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and yet God doth not take himselfe bound by that Covenant to give them grace and salvation, to whom we may and must hope, he hath given them.</p>
               <p>And, (as for the <hi>Children of Heathens)</hi> I know they may (for ought we know) be under Gods Election; but whiles they are Infants, and so shew not any signe of actuall vocation (as indeed they cannot) and their parents are appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently without the Church; I have no ground to conclude any of them Elected; because I find the whole body of Heathens (as such) excluded the Covenant, which is the only warrantable ground of my Charity. Eph. 2. 12.</p>
               <p>In a word, I desire no man to subscribe to my
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:103490:15"/>
                  <hi>opinion</hi> herein, except my <hi>grounds</hi> satisfie him. And though no man should be satisfied either in my opinion, or the grounds of it, I shall not be offended at him. For if I be out of the way herein, I suppose it doth not a jot prejudice my maine undertaking, seeing there are abundance more <hi>pricious uses of Infant-Baptisme,</hi> that stand upon surer grounds, though it should be granted, [that it conveighs pardon of sins or sanctifying grace actually to none.] And yet I thinke I was not to blame, that having some ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions of a probability it might be so (which yet are very strong upon me) I suggested it to you as a consideration not to be slighted, to induce you to present your Children to Baptism.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103490:17"/> Besides in the case of <hi>baptism,</hi> the Papists hold, <hi>that Baptisme in its receivers, works such a renovation, as that there remaines no originall sin, at least, under the proper notion of sin,</hi> so as <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Si quis per Jesu Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti Domini nostri gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam quae baptismate confertur, reatum pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cati origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, aut eti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am asserit, non tollit totum id quod verā, et propriam peccati ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tignem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathema fit.</hi> Sess. 5.</note> to render them obnoxious to the wrath of God, and the damnation of hell. And this is the effect of their <hi>opus operatum,</hi> in Baptisme. On the contrary, I owne the <hi>inherence of Originall sin</hi> in Infants after Baptisme, which abundantly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares in the fruits it afterward brings forth, when they come to a capacity of acting elective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and that their Baptisme doth no way take from <hi>Originall concupiscence</hi> the true and genuine nature of sin.</p>
               <p>Onely, I suppose, a possibility, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that in some elect infants, <hi>viz.</hi> those of them that dye in Infancy, the season of Gods doing that which all Christians acknowledge is done at one time or other, before the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of soule and body, <hi>(viz:</hi> their justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and renovation) is rather the time of baptisme then any other time. And I must tell you, did the Popist Doctrine of the <hi>opus opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> extend no farther, then <hi>Infant Baptisme;</hi> and hold forth no more, then that God doth at the time of Baptisme, and in, and with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, justifie and sanctifie some Infants, I know no popery in it. For I find many Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papists write larger then this comes to. As, for <hi>justification,</hi> some say, that <hi>all the Infants of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parents being sincerely presented to God in Baptisme, are freed from the guilt of original sin:</hi> but for a <hi>reall Change,</hi> they utterly deny it, (though I suppose it will be hard to prove from
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103490:17"/> the Scripture, that God ever wrought or promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to worke, a <hi>relative</hi> Change, without a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</hi> I am sure, the Apostle Paul in that golden Chaine, joynes them, the linke of justification, is annexed to that of <hi>vocation</hi> on one hand, and <hi>glorification</hi> on the other. And although there be some difference to which of these two, <hi>(voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or glorification) sanctification</hi> belongs; yet, I doe not find, but that all Orthodox divines, judge it included in one, or both.)</p>
               <p>Others, grant both justification and sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Baptisme, but affirme the extent of them in too great a latitude; to wit to all infants duely baptized, and not laying any impediment, of themselves, to hinder the taking place of that grace, (which indeed no Infants can doe, when infants; and afterwards, it implyes a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to suppose an impediment may be layd to hinder that grace that is received before in Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.)</p>
               <p>One reverend man had a peculiar fancy, he supposed all elect Infants, to have pardon and the seed of grace in baptisme, and this seed not extinct, though many yeares continuing in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of them, till conversion. And yet all these farre from Popery even in this point; both in their owne judgments, and esteemed so in the Charity of others. I neede not name parties, nor am I willing to doe it; partly, because I am loth to seeme ambitious of being knowne to dissent from men of great names; and partly, to avoyd occasion of commencing suites against me, upon a businesse wherein I am extremely unwilling to contend.</p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:103490:18"/>
               <p>To shut up this whole businesse; <hi>neighbour,</hi> if <hi>all</hi> these Orthodox Divines be not out, there is such a thing possible, and probable, as justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Infants <hi>in articulo Baptismi,</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry instant of baptisme: and if <hi>many</hi> of them be not out, <hi>sanctification</hi> too. All the dispute is concerning the extent of the grace so confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>They that extend it farthest, enlarge the comfort of that Doctrine to all believing parents concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their issue: they that contract it most, (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom, (and possibly beyond most of whom) I reckon my selfe to be) doe not so strai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, but that they render every particular be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving parent no lesse capable of improveing it to his comfort; seeing whatever is Gods purpose concerning this or that particular Child accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the decree of Election, they allow him an equall ground from the Covenant, and the seale thereof, to conclude <hi>every</hi> such Child of his, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infancy, under the same grace, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to <hi>any.</hi> So that, which judgment soever you most incline to, you will see cause for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement I gave you to present your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Baptisme, from the possible, yea probable present advantage accrewing thereby, in their actuall <hi>justification,</hi> and <hi>sanctification.</hi>

               <p>You cannot put me upon a welcomer taske. For I verily perswade my selfe, since the <hi>neglect</hi> of Infant-Baptisme, and (which is worse) the <hi>contempt</hi> sinfully cast upon it, in divers places of the Land, this worke is lesse successefully carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by Gods painful Ministers; and they have too much cause to complaine, of a strange barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the wombe of the Gospell, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son with former times, which I impute to these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To the just judgment of God upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that after so gracious a continuance of the Gospel, and its <hi>holy mercies</hi> among them for so many yeares, unthankfully began to grow wil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ling to let the <hi>Lease</hi> of such a precious priviledg <hi>run out</hi> without taking any care to <hi>renew</hi> it to their posterity after them: a sin, which you may remember, I have deeply and justly Charged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the principles of Anabaptisme in our former <note place="margin">P. 61, 62. 79, 80</note> discourse.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, (me-thinkes) when I seriously consider the reason of the slow progresse of this worke of conversion, I seeme to hear God say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing concerning England, <hi>Ah, ungratefull Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! Have I this requitall from you, for the derivation of Church-mercies, and Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercies to you, through the meanes of Infant-Baptisme, that you begin to dispute away the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that I have to your posterity, and (like profane</hi>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:103490:19"/>
                  <hi>Esaus) contemne your best birthright, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and solemne seale thereof? Have you a mind to dissolve the bond betweene me, and your posterity? Had you rather have them visible members of the Pagan world, then weare the badge of Christians? Is my family growne so contemptible a thing in your eyes, that you care not to have your Children beare so much as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible relation to it, or be seene in my livery? Will, then, take your option, you shall not need take much paines to disoblige them from me, and me from them. I will save you the labour of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting downe that contemned relation to me: whiles you dispute I will</hi> dis-Spirit <hi>mine owne or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and so they shall grow heathens</hi> under <hi>them, whom you would faine make heathens</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. To the grievous prejudice, against those <hi>Ministers, Societyes,</hi> and <hi>Ordinances,</hi> in which God hath beene wont to scatter saving grace in this Nation; which are, if not raysed, yet day-ly fomented by <hi>Anabaptisme.</hi> I confesse, I have sometimes wondred, (supposing our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters to be in an errour in the misapplication of an Ordinance) how any man pretending to reason or conscience, can justify a separation from it barely upon that account; especially in another Ordinance different from that upon which the misapplication is Charged. But upon serious consideration of the matter, I can scarce see, but the principles of that profession of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, necessarily involve it. For supposing Infant-Baptisme null, as they doe, they cannot looke upon either Ministers or people in our
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103490:19"/> Congregations, as other then non-members of the visible Church, and so looke upon all the Ordinances administred in those congregations by those ministers, as no Church-Ordinances, and (by just consequence) administred without a <hi>call,</hi> and not to be attended on with expectation of a <hi>blessing.</hi> Now experience shewes, that nothing more hinders the operation of the <hi>word,</hi> then a prejudicate opinion of the <hi>preacher,</hi> and among all prejudices against the preacher, there are none more operative this way, then those that call the Authority of his <hi>place,</hi> and <hi>calling</hi> into Question. So that, seeing Anabaptism raiseth, and nourseth, and propagateth these prejudices, against that Ministry, wherein conversion in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dayes hath beene dispensed, it is no wonder if it be unhappily accessory to the hinderance of its progresse, more then hath beene observed heretofore, under the like means.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To the Actuall disengagement of many young people, (among whom usually the streame of converting grace most runs) from all relation, to God, Church, and Ordinances, till of their owne Choyce they take up Baptisme at yeares of discretion. Now whiles persons live loose from such engagements, as in their proper nature and tendency further conversion, no wonder if the worke go slowly on among them. As on the other side, I shall shew you by and by, how many speciall advantages a Child of a believing parent, dedicated to God in Infancy, by Baptisme, hath over another, suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to graze in the wild common of the world, without Gods sheep-marke upon him, towards
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103490:20"/> this necessary worke.</p>

               <p>1. <hi>First.</hi> then, By way of <hi>externall meanes.</hi> The principles, and practise of Infant-Baptisme afford more advantages of externall meanes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conversion, then the contrary principles and practise doe.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>First,</hi> Converting <hi>Ordinances</hi> and the <hi>promises of profit</hi> by them, are the peculiar por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Infants, thus in Covenant with God, as soone as they are in capacity of using them. God bestowes the word upon the Church, and its members, upon <hi>another account,</hi> then upon other people. Persons unrelated to God, enjoy the word only <hi>providenti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lly,</hi> when the sound of it reacheth them. But the word in the Church, is a <hi>Covenant-mercy</hi> God is engaged to teach them his Lawes, and his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances he is under no such obligation to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Every Scholar under a Schoolmasters peculiar charge, may by his relation expect
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:103490:20"/> teaching from him. But other Children, who are not admitted into his Schoole (it is true, he may occasionally as he pleaseth teach them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but) they are not in a capacity to chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and claime it from him. A ministers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his flock, binds him to preach the word constantly to them, and every one of his Flock may expect it from him as duely as the Lords day comes, and upon other occasionall seasons as God shall offer them. But others, though in the next parish, have no such tie upon him; though he may in kindnesse step out now and then, and bestow a sermon, where he sees need.</p>
               <p>In like manner, Jesus Christ who is the <hi>great Shepherd of the Sheepe,</hi> is under a peculiar obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, to feed all those, who are of his flock; and they may claime at his hands their <hi>food in due season.</hi> But what hath he to doe, but by meere courtesie, with those without the fold? As the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> saith, in another case, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing censures, another ordinance for conversion (in its season) <hi>what have I to doe to judge th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m that are without?</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 12. So may Christ say, (as to point of obligation or Covenant) <hi>what have I to doe, to carry my fodder out of my fold? To teach those that are without?</hi> Now, surely, an Ordinance is there most likely to doe good, where there is a peculiar right thereunto. Me thinkes, the consideration of that place, Rom. 3. 12. Makes very much to the illustrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (if not confirmation) of this point. It seemes the question then was seriously pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, as the parallel to it, is now capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously. <hi>What advantage then hath the Jew, and</hi>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:103490:21"/>
                  <hi>what profit is there in circumcision?</hi> Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, <hi>much every way: Chiefely because to them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> Others, heard of them, and (possibly) might have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of their Scriptures, (as Ptolomeus Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus set the 72 Interpreters to translate the Old Testament into Greeke, that it might, (being then the learned language) propagate the knowledge of the Jewish Law, through the world.) But yet the Oracles of God were <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and this upon the account of <hi>circumcision.</hi> They were a people, that were <hi>so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely,</hi> and <hi>sacramentally</hi> the Lords, and God <hi>commits his Oracles</hi> to them. Hee <hi>permitted</hi> them to others <hi>providentially:</hi> but hee <hi>committed</hi> them to the Jewes <hi>foederally,</hi> as the Law of the Kingdom he would govern them by. They owed their Bible to circumcision. <hi>Gods covenant was in their flesh,</hi> and therefore God entrusted them with the <hi>Instrument,</hi> in which it was drawn up. To bring home this to the present case. It is cleare, that the <hi>oracles of God,</hi> (that <hi>pure Law,</hi> which (as David saith) <hi>converts the soule)</hi> Ps. 19. 7. are the protion of a people in Covenant with God; Our Infants, therefore, being, according to our principles, in Covenant with God, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled to the Bible, and all the contents thereof; and so the precious effects of that word, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of conversion is one of the principall, may bee comfortably expected to redound to them; &amp; this their Title is pleadable for them, and by them, as soone as they are capable of receiving any bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit there from.</p>
               <p>Adde to this; The <hi>Ministers,</hi> the <hi>dispensers of</hi>

               <p>I deny not, but hee may. For the mercy of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103490:22"/> God to his people, is many times, larger then their faith or prayers. So, that God may looke upon those children as in Covenant with him, and deale with them as such, whom their parents deny him a title to. Even when the people of Israel, idolatruosly <hi>offered their children to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech,</hi> yet God calls them <hi>his children</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. <note place="margin">Ezek. 16. 21.</note> They gave them away from him, but God would not part with his title to them so; so though those of the Anabaptisticall way, (some through loose and profane principles, and others through consciencious scruples) deny God the right hee hath to their children, yet God may, and I doubt not, doth, many times, <hi>remember t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And as for those few, of those principles, who may challenge the reputation of being truely godly; I dare not but thinke, that they may obtaine grace for their children by prayer, upon other grounds. But, this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly affirme, that they cannot plead for it with that strength of Argument, or have so grounded a confidence to prevaile, whiles they deny the Covenant-interest of their children in those Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and promises, which hold it forth, and conveigh it, as others that act faith upon it, may and do, with comfort, and successe.</p>

                     </gap>facto,</hi> by the multitude of converts, among the children of <hi>Poedo-baptists,</hi> that ordinances and meanes of grace tending thereunto, are peculiarly theirs. But on the contrary, how many of their children, do wee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:103490:23"/> see running the same riot with others? Can it bee supposed, that ordinances should bee so vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly ineffectuall upon such numbers of those, to whom they, and the blessing of them do pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly belong?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>No wonder at all, that it should bee so. The Apostle answers this very objection (in my jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gment) in the case of the Jewes, &amp; their Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. when hee had spoken concerning the peculiar right of the Jewes to the <hi>Oracles of God,</hi> v. 2. he foresaw the objection that might thence bee started. <hi>But how then came it to passe, that so many of them were never the better for them?</hi> If God had vouchsafed them these oracles by a <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Title,</hi> a <hi>Covenant-title,</hi> it would (in like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood) have beene otherwise. Seeing therefore so many did not believe, it followes that eyther it was no peculiar priviledg to them to enjoy the ordinances by covenant, whereas others enjoyed them by providence onely: or else that Gods faithfulnesse fayled in bestowing that mercy upon them by Covenant, which they were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better for.</p>
               <p>The Apostle answers this objection thus. <hi>What then? what if some did not believe? shall their unbeliefe make the faith if God of none effect? q. d.</hi> The <hi>priviledge of the Jew,</hi> in the enjoyment of Ordinances, was continued to the Church, by Gods faithfulnesse, the unbeliefe of some not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding; and <hi>their owne misimprovement</hi> of that mercy justly exposed them to the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, <hi>notwithstanding them;</hi> which the Gentiles, upon the account of sinning against the Law of nature, and glimmerings of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:103490:23"/> light, underwent <hi>without them.</hi> So that though divers of them perished under them through unbeliefe, yet Gods Covenant in the vouchsafement of them was entrie and unbroken notwithstanding. Which Argument hee pursues copiously, and connexeth it with the precedent Chapter in the following verses. In like manner may I say concerning the <hi>Children of Poedobap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi> their priviledge in the peculiar right they have to converting ordinances is not at all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payred by the inefficacy of those ordinances, upon any, or any number of them. It is their priviledge to enjoy them, and it will bee the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of their guilt that they do not improve them. And although they have a peculiar right to the blessing of ordinances, as well as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances themselves; yet (because this right, is▪ (as the Covenant is that derives it) externall) it becomes ineffectuall to many, through their owne neglect of seeking to God in his owne way for the obtaining thereof. Besides, (to the shame of many of us it may bee spoken) divers parents among us do not understand, and others, (out of dissatisfaction as to their owne Covenant-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest) <hi>dare</hi> not, or through sinfull neglect <hi>do</hi> not plead with God for theit Children as they have sufficient warrant to do.</p>

The <hi>want of Originall righteousnesse,</hi> (ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther branch that wee ordinarily comprehend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Originall sin)</hi> is no lesse lively presented to our consideration in this ordinance, and that from the same notion of the <hi>ingrafting nature</hi> thereof.

And how then dare I, or any other under the guilt of so many actuall sins, plead our owne righteousnesse, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of our Justification? what is the thing wee call good nature, if nature in the very bud, nay blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some, bee thus voyd of goodnesse? Accept mee, Lord, in the righteousnesse of him, whose nature from the wombe was sanctifyed, and whose life to the grave was holy, seeing in its owne personall righteousnesse, the most innocent Age, shall not bee justifyed.

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:103490:31"/> a more peculiar consideration; viz. in the <hi>freenesse,</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of it. Baptisme at riper years, and the Lords Supper, signifie and seal the same remission, but the persons presupposed to bee so and so qualified. But in Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, as in Infant-circumcision heretofore, there is a lively representation of remission of sins and acceptance with God through the imputation of <hi>righteousnesse without workes,</hi> (as the Apostles phrase is, Rom. 4. 6.) That grand <hi>commendation</hi> of <hi>Gods love</hi> mentioned Rom. 5. 6, 7, 8, &amp;c. in <hi>Charists dying for us when wee were sinners, ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without strength,</hi> and <hi>in the reconciliation of enemies,</hi> is lively exhibited in Infant-Baptisme. That administration, in my Judgment, bespeaks all sinners thus: <hi>Lo here, all yee that looke on, is there any love like this love, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends an act of grace and pardon to a filthy pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted sinner, one that hath no worth to deserve it, no power to requite it? Are there no poore soules here, that dare not lay hands upon Christ, and pardon, because of their owne unworthinesse; that are in doubt whether Christ will receive them, till they bee thus, and thus graciously qualified, as they propound to themselves to bee? Soul, if thou thinke to bring any thing to Christ, but thy sores, and thy diseases, and thy wants, and thy weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, thou disparagest this grace and endangerest thine owne salvation. Behold in this administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what a paterne of pardoning mercy, God exhibites for thine encouragement. Here is guilt confessed, and unworthynesse acknowledged, and impotency ad inability apparent. What is there in this little embleme of want and weakenesse,</hi>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:103490:31"/>
                  <hi>that may bee supposed, to incline God to any thoughts of favour? Here is the bloud of sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for remission of sins, sacramentally applyed to one that cannot come under the suspicion of any personall worthinesse. Come then, thou selfe-dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged sinner, plead thy Infant-Baptisme, for free grace, and gratuitous forgivenesse. Aske God (with reverence) whether thou bee now more unworthy to receive the mercy, and grace sealed, then thou at that time wer'st to receive the seale of it? Aske him, (with humility) whether hee did not seale to thee at that time, to tell thee, that hee lookes not upon what man deserves, when hee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to bestow his owne grace? whether hee will not have thee now enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, (by remission of sins, that opens the doore of it) as a little child; who when thou wer'st a little child indeed, opened the Kingdome of heaven to thee, in Baptisme, the seal of that remission? Say, Lord, I acknowledge my selfe unworthy, as then I was, let not my unworthinesse bee a barre to mee now, which thy Sacramentall grace then broke through, with</hi> [a non-obstante.] <hi>Let not that barre shut mee out from the grace of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>[3] And as much may bee said for <hi>conviction of judgment,</hi> from Infant-Baptisme, (if the word <hi>[judgment]</hi> bee taken for <hi>[inhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now, that baptismall water signifyes, the

                  <hi>grace of the Spirit,</hi> as well as the <hi>bloud of Christ,</hi> I know no man that makes any doubt. If any do, they may do well to consider, what is meant in that Phrase of being <hi>borne againe of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and of the Spirit.</hi> Joh 3. 5. Which phrase either denotes the necessity of the <hi>spirituall grace</hi> of baptisme to salvation, as superadded to the <hi>material water</hi> of that sacrament, (not asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an absolute necessity of baptisme to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but supposing Baptisme, and requiring more then baptisme to salvation;) q. d. [in vaine doe men thinke meerely, by thronging to Johns Baptisme, to <hi>flee from the wrath to come; if</hi> there be no more then baptisme, there is no more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of salvation, then there was without it. <hi>Except a man bee regenerated not only of water, but of the Spirit also, hee cannot see the Kingdome of God:</hi> Or else it is, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>water, and the Spirit,</hi> for the <hi>water of the Spirit,</hi> or the <hi>Spirits baptisme.</hi> Now if <hi>Baptismal water,</hi> were not the <hi>embleme</hi> (and so, sacramentall <hi>signe)</hi> of the <hi>regeneration of the Spirit,</hi> the connextion betweene them in either sense, were very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper. Such an expression wee have also <hi>Eph.</hi> 5. 26. where wee have the <hi>Love of Christ to the Church</hi> set downe as an imitable precedent to Husbands in their love to their wives. <hi>Husbands, love your Wives, even as Christ also loved the Church, and gave himselfe for it, That hee might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word.</hi> In which Text wee may note, (1) The <hi>death</hi> of Christ, the thing held forth in Baptisme; <hi>Hee gave himselfe for it.</hi> (2) The <hi>end</hi> why Christ gave himselfe, <hi>That hee</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:103490:32"/>
                  <hi>might sanctify and cleanse it.</hi> (3.) The <hi>meanes</hi> by which hee doth it, viz. 1. <hi>externall</hi> with the <hi>washing of water. 2. internall</hi> (superadded to that to make it effectuall) <hi>by the word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that by the apparent Analysis of this Text, it is plaine, <hi>that Baptismall water doth signify cleansing, sanctifying,</hi> and (by consequence) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace:</hi> and that not <hi>only</hi> as a <hi>duty</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in required of us, that were are thereby enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>cleanse our selves from all filthinesse of</hi>

The <hi>word,</hi> (relating to sacraments) is eyther, the <hi>word of institution,</hi> the ordination of God, appointing them as means to their proper ends: or the <hi>word of promise</hi> annexed to the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to assure us of benefit by it.

A parallell place to this, is, Tit. 3. 5. <hi>according to his mercy hee saved us by the</hi>

In a word, when I consider how often sanctifying grace is expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Scripture, by <hi>cleansing,</hi> and (the meanes thereof) <hi>washing with water;</hi> I cannot straighten a sacramentall element so as to exclude it from one principall part of its Scripturall signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and that founded in so apparent an Analogy and resemblance as (in the point in hand) there is betweene baptismall water and the renewing of the H.

               <p>I thinke I may by this time take it for granted, that Baptisme is not only a seale of regeneration, on <hi>our parts,</hi> obliging us to the <hi>duty;</hi> but also <hi>on Gods,</hi> engaging <hi>him</hi> to bestow the <hi>grace of</hi> it. Which, if it bee granted, (as I question not but (by most orthodox) it will) it will follow that (seeing the <hi>seale</hi> necessarily supposeth the <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,</hi> as the <hi>writing</hi> to w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> it is annexed) the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:103490:33"/> of regenerating grace are sealed in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, which promises wee call, <hi>absolute promises,</hi> or <hi>promises of the first grace.</hi> Now, because the administration hereof <hi>at riper yeares,</hi> suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, as I have formerly told you, (at least, by the profession of faith and repentance) this <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall regeneration</hi> already wrought; therefore to <hi>persons admitted at that Age,</hi> Baptisme seales properly, (according to their capacity) the grace of <hi>progressive regeneration:</hi> but to <hi>Infants,</hi> (whose <hi>actuall regeneration</hi> is not supposed in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration) it seales <hi>initiall regeneration,</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the promises exhibiting it. And I do no way doubt, but that <hi>circumcision</hi> of old did the same. It signified <hi>the putting off the body of the sins of the flesh,</hi> as may bee inferred from the Apostle, Col. 2. 11. and that promise Deut. 30. ver. 6. <hi>I will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed,</hi> sounds so like, the <hi>putting off the body of the sins of the flesh,</hi> in the place forenamed; that it is to mee more then probable, that God therein expresseth a <hi>spirituall grace</hi> in <hi>sacramentall termes,</hi> to shew, that, that sacrament was a seale of that grace. Adde to this, that the phrase of <hi>[circumcision of the heart]</hi> as required over and above <hi>the circumcision of the flesh</hi> to make a true <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>son of Abraham,</hi> by the Apostle, Rom. 2. ult. as also, the phrase of <hi>[an uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer 9. 26. Act. 7. 51.</note>
                  <hi>heart,</hi> and <hi>uncircumcised in heart]</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed to the Jewes, by way of exprobration <hi>(viz.</hi> as charging them with the want of that grace, which the outward ordinance sealed, whiles yet they boasted in a barren ordinance;) seeme to speake aloud such neerenesse of relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:103490:34"/> the one and the other, <hi>[sacramentall circumcision,</hi> and <hi>heart-renovation]</hi> as is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the <hi>outward signe</hi> and the <hi>inward grace. Now, as to the adult Jewes</hi> and <hi>proselytes</hi> who were circumcised, the promises of heart-circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, were ratified, according to their present capacity; viz. to assure the conferring of more, and more <hi>degrees</hi> of inward renovation: so, to <hi>their Infants,</hi> they cannot but be interpreted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their capacity; and so circumcision, to them, sealed those promises, in the utmost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of them, and principally, the grace of first regeneration, which lyes most plaine in the Termes, and is legible in the very foreheads of them.</p>
               <p>Adde to this, further, that, Baptisme (being a sacrament of <hi>ingrafting</hi> and <hi>admission</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the church) most properly must bee supposed to exhibite <hi>that grace,</hi> by which we are so <hi>ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>admitted</hi> into the mysticall body of Christ. Now wee are not <hi>ingrafted</hi> into Christ, but when wee are made <hi>living members;</hi> and that is not, till wee have a principle of life infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed into us; which life wee receive in the infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of <hi>initiall grace.</hi> So that Baptisme being Gods seale to our admission into Christs body, is a seale of that grace by which wee are thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>Once more, Baptisme being (as it is generally granted amongst orthodox Divines) a <hi>seale of the Covenant of grace,</hi> either seales the <hi>whole</hi> Covenant, or but <hi>part</hi> of it, let any one assigne clearly from the Scripture what part it seals, and what not. If the <hi>whole,</hi> (as I
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:103490:34"/> conceive, when the Scripture layes the promise as the ground of Baptisme, it means the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, <hi>I will bee thy God and the God of thy seed▪</hi> in its uttermost latitude and extent) then, the promises of initiall grace as part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
               <p>Nay lastly, there being but <hi>two</hi> seales of the Covenant of Grace) it is necessary, that either <hi>some part</hi> of the Covenant is altogether unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or else that one of those two seales must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie it whatsoever it bee. That any part of the Covenant, wants the ratification of a seale alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, I suppose no one will affirme Now, I conceive, the sacrament of the Lords supper doth not confirme that part of it, which exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits the first grace, because in the nature of it, it is a Sacrament of nourishment; and so neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily supposeth life in the person participating thereof. It remaines then, that the said promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the first grace are sealed up in Baptisme, and most eminently in Infant-Baptisme, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the grounds before layd. Which, as to mee, it is a rationall proofe of the lawfulnesse of the application of Baptisme to Infants, so it much furthers the application of the doctrine of it, if improved by serious meditation.

               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> because it seemes improper to call those scriptures, <hi>promises,</hi> which exhibit God inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to bestow the <hi>first grace.</hi> For promises, are made to some persons or other, by whom they are pleadable. Now that which renders any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise pleadable to any person, is some <hi>nominall</hi> or <hi>virtuall</hi> mention of him, in the grant. But to the <hi>promises of initiall grace</hi> (as you call them) there is no such specification, or nomination reall or virtuall annexed, by vertue of which any particular person may plead them. Nor indeed, can there bee. For, either that specification must bee <hi>Election,</hi> or the <hi>purchase of Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ist,</hi> or some <hi>qualification</hi> or other in the person, making him a fit receiver, when another is not. <hi>Election,</hi> is a title not pleadable by any, but by speciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, which I suppose, you will not grant. The <hi>purchase of Christ</hi> is not pleadable by any, except upon evidence; that in that purchase Christ intended him in particular, and that is as darke and unpleadable a Title in this case as Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, except you hold <hi>universall redemption</hi> in a latitude beyond most men, viz. as including an <hi>universall purchase of grace;</hi> and yet then also, it were not pleadable by any one, more then ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. As for <hi>personall qualifications,</hi> they must either bee <hi>gracious</hi> or <hi>common.

I had rather use a lesse proper or lesse significant expression, then bee suspected of innovating <hi>doctrines</hi> by innovating <hi>Terme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> Yet I must tell you, it is not improper to call that a promise which is pleadable by no one person in particular; and as these are made to the Church, so they are proper promises. For a promise may bee made to a <hi>Corporation;</hi> and there is nothing more usuall then such promises in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture made to the whole Church, so as to bee fulfilled to particulars included in that Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to Gods owne will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Such is the promise of <hi>continuation of Gospel-ministery and ordinances, and Christs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence in them to the worlds End,</hi> Mat. 28. 19, 20. and such is the promise of preserving the Church against the <hi>gates of Hell,</hi> and many others. <note place="margin">Mat. 16. 18.</note> Which promises are fulfilled, and shall bee to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:103490:36"/> the whole church in some or other parts of it, to the worlds end; and that according to the rule of Gods secret decree only. Now although no particular Church or ministry can challenge God upon these promises, under any peculiar claime, yet (God having not declared his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret purpose to performe them to this, and not to that particular ministry or society) they may all plead them, as branches of that body to which they are made; yet so, as to leave him to his liberty, to do as hee pleaseth according to his secret determination. So, (with submission to better judgments) do I conceive those <hi>promises of initial grace,</hi> to bee made to the <hi>whole body</hi> of the Church; and my reason is, because I find them, so drawne up, without any particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of such and such persons in the Church. Nay I find the body of the Church mentioned in divers (if not all) those promises. <hi>I will circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 30. 6. <hi>Israel,</hi> and the <hi>seed of Israel,</hi> were termes then commensurate to the whole visible Church of God. So, <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, I will put my lawes into their mind,</hi> &amp;c. Jer 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10. So <hi>I will give you a new heart</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>I will put my Spirit within you,</hi> and <hi>yee shall dwell in the land that I gave to your Fathers:</hi> so that the promise is made to the whole <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall Church</hi> of the Jewes, as such. Now the Apostle telling us that the <hi>partition wall is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken downe,</hi> and wee are <hi>coheyres with them,</hi> Ephes. 3. 6. and Christian Jewes and Gentiles being now become one Catholick Church; these
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:103490:36"/> promises extend to the Gentile-Church in the same latitude; and are accordingly pleadable by the <hi>whole Church</hi> now, as then, for its visible Members, and by those members for <hi>themselves</hi> in particular, as parts of the whole.</p>
               <p>And therefore, you see a particular Christian need not bee driven to plead <hi>Election,</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of these promises to himself▪ or his child, but only the Covenant of grace, as made with the Church visible for either, upon the account of membership therein. Nor need hee plead any <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Qualification,</hi> for this only <hi>relative qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> is sufficient without any <hi>personall</hi> one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>gracious,</hi> or <hi>common,</hi> to bring him so farre within the reach of those promises, as to afford him a good plea for a share in them, for himself or his.</p>
               <p>Yea, upon the same account, may hee ground his plea upon the very <hi>purchase of Christ,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either supposing <hi>that Christ dyed to purchase grace for all;</hi> or a <hi>revelation,</hi> that <hi>Christ pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased it for him in particular.</hi> For, however Christ knew whom hee had chosen, and had their names engraven upon his heart when hee suffered, so that none can <hi>eventualy</hi> obtaine any saving fruit of his death, but those so intended by him; yet, seeing Christs church visible upon earth, is the first subject of all promises, and declarations concerning the benefits of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, and particularly concerning this part of his purchase, <hi>santification,</hi> as hath beene before shewed) every particular member may plead in the name of Christ for the grace so promised, taking it as granted, that there is no legall obstruction against him, more then another in the same capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:103490:37"/>

               <p>The use is easily deducible from the premises.

                     </gap> all</hi> to its very nature, and essence, as the former. And those <note place="margin">II.</note> are.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A consideration of the mercyes vouch saved through Infant-Baptisme, and by vertue of its Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A consideration of the engagement entered into by Infant-Baptisme on our parts.</p>
               <p>The consideration of the mercyes vouchsafed through Infant-Baptisme and its Covenant, which amount to a very great reckoning, the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall summe whereof (in a word) is cast up in this, the solemne admission into the number of visible Church-members, and enstating in all the priviledges of that membership; will much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the value of them, and further the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of them, in order to conversion; if you take in to aggravate them this grand circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. That therein there was a gracious act of anticipating or preventing mercy. <hi>Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mercy,</hi> hath alwayes by Gods people, beene looked upon, as a mercy of largest dimensions. When God is before-hand with a person, in shewing kindnesse, hee displayes the banner of free-grace all abroad; in so much as there can bee no pretension of any thing on their part to obscure it in any measure, but what comes too late to stand in competition with it.</p>
               <p>Now in the mercy vouchsafed through Infant-Baptisme,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:103490:38"/> and its Covenant, there is a double prevention or anticipation on Gods part.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Hee prevents whatever good can bee sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to proceed from us, to render him our debtour; so that that Question takes unavoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable hold of us for conviction, <hi>Who hath first given to him?</hi> Rom. 11. 35.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hee prevents a great deale of evill, wee might, had not hee taken such early hold of us, have fallen into.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As the mercy vouchsafed in Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and its Covenant, <hi>prevents any good</hi> that can proceed from us, it may conduce to conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by some such meditations as these.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alas! what a disingenuous heart have I, to bolt the doore against mercy; against mercy cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting mee, and beseeching mee to bee happy, and that before I could so much as apprehend my selfe so miserable, as to stand in need of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and therefore before I could make the least motion towards mine owne happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse!

And how dis-ingenuous, &amp; unkind is it in mee, to go about to annull the match, by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate refusall! Had the disadvantage of this</hi>

               <p n="2">2. As the mercy vouchsafed in Infant-bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and its Covenant, <hi>prevents a great deale of evill</hi> which wee might have fallen into; so the after consideration of it, may conduce to some persons conversion by some such apprehensions as these. <hi>Ah, Lord! How many thousands are there in the world, whose very cradles stand upon the brinke of Hell! And so did mine too, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when the very guilt, and pollution of my nativity, rendered mee alike obnoxious to eternall</hi>

How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny desperate dangers have I escaped, wherein death threatned mee, and hell gaped for mee, merely because I was thine! Since I came to yeares of election, (though I have beene too bad at best, yet) how much worse had I beene, had I not beene thine? Certainly, there is something pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar in common mercyes and deliverances, for which I ought to acknowledge my selfe obliged to thee, who, as thou hast beene in Covenant with mee from my Mothers brests, so hast thou (no question) beene mindfull of that Covenant, in the dispensations of thy providence towards mee. And therefore it concernes mee to bee mindfull of my duty, to become thine graciously, by an actuall surrender of my selfe to thee, who hast made mee thine by a sacramentall covenant, and since that, layd out so many gracious providences upon mee, in pursuance thereof.</hi>

               <p>But <hi>Sir,</hi> are not thousands of baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants taken off providentially, from the land of the living, before they come to considering yeares? And are not divers persons baptized in Infancy left to a very great height of sin, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy? So that it seemes, the ground of this converting consideration is not layd in Infant-Baptisme or the Covenant sealed therein, for
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:103490:39"/> then it would be common to all so baptized; but wee see plainely the contrary; that abundance of them, are not capable of such considerations as these, as not having experience of these mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes; and some are, that are not in Covenant nor baptized, as Heathens children. How then impute you these mercyes to the Covenant and Infant Baptism?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>I answer you, to both these objections, &amp; to the last, <hi>First.</hi> All providentiall mercyes to the visible Church, and its members, as such, are common Covenant-mercyes: thence wee find the Covenant pleaded, in relation to providentiall delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, on the behalfe of the whole visible body of the Church, <hi>Psal.</hi> 74. 20. and God when hee bestowes such mercyes upon such a people, is said to <hi>keep and remember;</hi> and when hee doth not, to <hi>breake his Covenant,</hi> Deut. 7. 12, 13. &amp;c. and Exod. 6. 5. and Zech. 11. 10. &amp;c. By consequence therefore, every member of that visible body, (and among these (by our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples) are Infants born, and baptized within the Church) may looke upon every providential mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as a Covenant-mercy, though of a common na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>id est,</hi> such as is bestowed in common upon Covenanted Church-members, as such, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any speciall consideration of election, or faith, or any other distinguishing character dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferencing one from another. And surely, the patience and <hi>goodnesse of God,</hi> if meerely provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentiall, <hi>should lead to repentance,</hi> Rom 2. 4. much more, if foederall. So that those provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences which are common both to Heathens, and Christians in profession, from Infancy, will yet
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:103490:40"/> aggravate the impenitency, and obstinacy of Christians beyond Heathens, because, though <hi>[as providences]</hi> they bee common to men, as men; yet <hi>[as Covenant-providences]</hi> they are common only to those that are within the pale of the visible church; and so are (give mee leave to say,) common within a certaine pale or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whereas you say, that it seemes these mercyes here considered, are not mercyes deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Infant-Covenant, because many such Infants as are visibly in Covenant, and baptized, partake not of them, some through praemature death, others otherwise. I answer, It doth not follow that they are not Covenant-mercyes, to those that enjoy them, because they are not vouchsafed to all in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. For Gods Covenant doth not engage him to bestow the same mercyes upon all Covenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no not in temporals. Every Covenanter during his standing within the Covenant, hath some mercyes or other flowing to him through it. And I am sure whatever those mercyes are, they are to be made use of as <hi>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rds of love</hi> to lead those that enjoy them to repentance. My drift is only to shew, that what-ever deliverances provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vouchsafes a person in Covenant with God from Infancy, are imputable to that Covenant as the spring of them, by a spirit piously dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to improve them; and as I have instanced in some suiting some such persons, you or any other may enlarge the same consideration to more, as any different experience<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of Gods mercy in any sort whatsoever, occurre to them in their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103490:40"/> owne observation. But an Anabaptist by his principles cannot looke upon any such mercyes vouchsafed in infancy, or before actuall faith, under a Covenant consideration, in any sense; and therefore cannot improve them otherwise, then as meere providences.</p>

               <p>I hope <hi>Sir,</hi> you will favourably indulge mee a liberty of pondering what you herein say, as you have done in other particulars before. For indeed I am by experience taught to bee shye of giving in a suddaine assent even to that, against which (for the present) I have nothing to object; and I am assured you will lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the upshot and issue of your endeavours, by a considering, and therefore slow, disciple. For what you may want of encouragement, by the speedinesse of his through conviction, I am perswaded, in the Issue you will reap in the firmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and constancy of his continuance therein. Principles and opinions suddainly taken up, are too often as suddanily layd downe againe. Wherefore I shall lay this aside for second thoughts, and intreate you to proceed to your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond head of considerations suggested from In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptisme and its Covenant conducing to conversion; viz. such as emerge from the engagement entered into thereby, on our parts.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>The favour you desire, neighbour, is such, as had need in this argument, to bee mutuall. For I my selfe am sensible, how much <hi>second thoughts</hi> in matters of Essay, (as my discourse concerning this subject is) may better ones <hi>first apprehensions.</hi> Something surely there is in these
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:103490:41"/> particulars, which possibly, I may not have the felicity to expresse so well, as others might, at the first conception of them: and therefore I must also reserve to my selfe a liberty of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering mine owne notions, or expressions, as upon a deliberate review I shall see cause: But (to draw towards a conclusion of this subject, in the answer of your last proposall) you are to know that the restipulation, or mutuall engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Baptisme layes upon us, is not lesse (on our part) valid, because of its Infant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration, as possibly to some it may seeme to bee. And therefore if Baptismall obligations at any age oblige us to conversion they do so no lesse at Infant-Age: So that here I shall need only to do these two things farther.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To shew that our engagement to bee the Lords, sealed on our parts in Baptisme, is never the lesse because that Baptisme was administred in Infancy.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To illustrate, and cleare up to you the manner how our Infant-engagement to God derives such considerations as promote con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version.</p>
               <p>For the first of these, I have given a short hint tending thereto, in my former booke, which I <note place="margin">Pag. 53. 54.</note> shall now enlarge in a few words. You may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore understand, that there is a twofold engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a <hi>virtuall</hi> engagement, and a <hi>formall</hi> or <hi>expresse</hi> engagement. Then are wee <hi>formally</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, when in expresse termes, wee take upon us any obligation; as when a man subscribes his owne hand, and sets his owne seale to a deed or bond; this the Law calls, <hi>a mans owne deed.</hi>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:103490:41"/> A <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtuall</hi> engagement, is when I am legally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to be engaged though in mine own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son I promise nothing, subscribe not, seal not. And such an engagement, is that, which binds a mans <hi>h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>yres, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>xecuters▪ and ministrators, and assignes</hi> in a bond or deed. The conditions of that bond or deed, are in law requirable at their hands, as if they were by their own personall act undertaken. And the reason of it is this; Those to whom by mee, such a benefit is derived, are supposed in equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to bee equally concerned with mee in the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then that it carryes with it The title, which by me such persons claym, <hi>transit cum onere,</hi> as Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers say, passeth to them with all incumbrances.

And to shew that the edge of my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite is not yet dulled with this large entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I will make bold to call for a dish that you promised to make mee partaker of for a close of the banquet, and I believe have not forgotten, and that is the applicatory notes upon the whole subject, which a while since I desired should bee set aside, till now.</p>

               <speaker>Poedo.</speaker>
               <p>Thus then, <hi>neighbour,</hi> (to shut up the whole matter) you see how much advantage many, wayes, may bee made of this contemned Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Infant-Baptisme. And therefore (upon the whole) take these closing animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>[1] That there is a very <hi>profane spirit</hi> fomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this nation under the wings of Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. For how can it bee other then such, which endeavours to extirpate so considerable a meanes for the advance of conversion, and sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you have seene Infant-Baptisme to bee? May wee not justly impute all those sad miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages (even in point of morality, and common honesty) which in the former and present Ages, Anabaptisme hath broken forth into, to this very cause; that such persons weakening that hold which God and they mutually had of each other, have sate the looser from him ever since; and so exposed themselves the more to Tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and provoked him to withdraw that assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:103490:45"/> which might have supported them to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter them? For this is a consequence ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily following upon the neglect or contempt of any ordinance of God: constant experience shewing, that as it is not in vaine to draw nigh to him in his owne appointed meanes, (seeme they never so absurd or irrationall to our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt reasons:) so it is not safe, to depart from him in any one of them, seeing it is a provoking presumption to expect God will meete us in by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes of our owne, when wee refuse to go out to meete him in the publique and rode-wayes, which hee hath appointed.</p>
               <p>[2.] That it is no small advantage that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan gets by our corrupt reasonings against di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Institutions; seeing thereby hee cuts us off from all that profit and advantage which (whiles wee dispute) wee might husband them unto. Certaine it is, in this particular ordinance, (and might by a serious spirit bee found in divers others) that <hi>disputes and contests are barren things:</hi> the pious and conside<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing practiser goes away with the benefit, whiles the curious Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionist is enquiring with Nicodemus, <hi>how can these things bee?</hi> suppose wee therefore, in this case, that hee that conscienciously disputes the right of Infants to Baptisme, comes off with the same satisfaction at last, which others, that make it no matter of dispute at all, enjoy all the while; yet hee must needs after all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonings confesse, that hee hath suffered the disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the losse of so much time for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, as hee hath spent in the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie.</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103490:45"/>
               <p>[3.] That the cause of Infant baptisme hath in this respect, lost many of its adherents, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no considerable paines hath beene taken heretofore by Ministers to informe, and by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians to study the way of improving it. Surely, had those that are now fallen off from this cause, to the adverse party, beene well disciplined herein, and accordingly found the experience of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Infant Baptisme before-mentioned, they would not have beene so easily perswaded to have submitted it to an ambiguous dispute. And wee may hence by experience learne how to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve our selves, and those under our charge, who (as yet) are unscrupled in the ordinance, from a temptation of scrupling it; <hi>to wit,</hi> by shewing them what use to make of it: in order whereunto, I judge it were not amisse to have some short Catechisme drawne up for parents, and masters, to teach their children and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, to that effect. And hereunto, I intend (God willing) to offer my help (according to my small proportion of abilityes) in an Essay of that kind, hoping it may not bee altogether unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to serious Christians, nor unprofitable, at least, till such while as an abler hand shall give them a better.</p>
               <p>[4.] That parents who present their children to this Ordinance should specially eye the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it to those whom they tender to God that way. Which if they do, they will see rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To labour to affect their owne <hi>hearts</hi> in that action, with sutable dispositions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:103490:46"/>2. To manage it in such a <hi>way</hi> as may render it most usefull.</p>
               <p>1. The <hi>hearts</hi> of parents in that action should bee affected,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>With an high and thank full esteeme of Gods rich mercy to them, and their families, above others;</hi> that hee honours them so farre as to make their issue the nursery of the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible: that (like <hi>honour</hi> given by <hi>patent,)</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity through a Covenant of grace descends in their line, and becomes (in a sort) hereditary. That such an inheritance as the Covenant of grace with all its mercyes, and promises, and priviledges should bee so farre made their Issues peculiar portion, as to bee pleadable in their names as soone as they have a being. That they have such a ground and footing of prayer for them, joy in them, and hope of them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they live or dye, as I have before shewen you at large.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>With a serious and sollicitous inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into their owne Covenant-relation to God, and covenant walking with him:</hi> so as to bee able to plead a saving interest in it for <hi>themselves,</hi> that so, they may bee furnished with a more lively and vigorous faith to urge it for their posterity: to find out, what occasions or advantages have beene given to God, eyther by their owne or their forefathers sinnes, to infringe that plea; and so repent for them, and renew that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant againe, <hi>toties quoties,</hi> as often as they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parents, with particular respect to such and such children. For although a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interest in the Covenant of grace (a visible
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:103490:46"/> church-membership I meane) in the parent, (although there bee no more) sufficiently enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles the child to that Covenant, so farre as hee him-selfe is related to it; and so, bee sufficient ground for his baptisme: yet it is only the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly parent that can plead it in faith for his child, and that so farre, as hee can hope or believe his owne spirituall and saving Interest therein, and takes course that every breach bee made up that may any way weaken his claime.</p>
               <p n="3">3. (From hence) <hi>with a great measure of faith and confidence,</hi> to the expecting of those Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant mercyes, which God therein promiseth, and Baptisme seales to his child, to bee effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally powred out upon him in Gods time and way: laying the mouth of faith to that full brest, the grand Charter of believers, <hi>[I will bee thy God, and the God of thy seed after thee]</hi> perpetually sucking, in relation to the present administration, the <hi>sincere milke</hi> of that vast, bound-lesse, endlesse, endlesse clause of entayle <hi>[thy seed,</hi> (how many soever) <hi>after thee,</hi> (for how many Ages soever) <hi>in their generations.]</hi> Surely, surely, very few parents bring a faith to their childrens baptisme, large enough for this promise. If they did, who knowes at how vast a distance for future generations, it might come in remembrance before God; so that the child, (give mee leave to speake a word that, though it looke like an Hyperbole, yet to a man that se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously studies that promise, is none) the child (I say) whose great-great grandfather is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne (if, at least, the world last so many gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations) may bee the better for it, though ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:103490:47"/> at so great a distance of time before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand.</p>
               <p n="4">4. (Hence also in the last place) <hi>with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of joy and comfort;</hi> looking upon that day, as the <hi>day</hi> of <hi>their</hi> childrens <hi>Espousalls</hi> to Jesus Christ; and by consequence, a day that should bee more joyfull to a godly parent, then, the day of their marriage to the best earthly Matches that possibly can bee desired. If a parent should live to see all his children well married; hee would say, and well hee might (as to the outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his posterity) what an happy man am I that have lived long enough, to see all my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren so well disposed of! But I tell all parents that feare God; that the days in which their children are baptized, are farre joyfuller dayes, then the dayes of their marriage (if it might so come to passe) to so many of the most potent and mighty Princes in the world: and thou that hast seene all thy children baptized, hast lived long enough to see them 10000 times better be stowed. Thou hast espoused then to Christ, and hee hath made them a jointure beyond the abilities of all the Monarchs of the world; and therefore write downe the dayes of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens Baptisme, as their <hi>Wedding-dayes,</hi> and as often as you have occasion to remember them, remember it is your duty to rejoyce in the Lord, and blesse him upon that account.</p>
               <p>II. They should manage it in such a way, as may render it most usefull: <hi>id est,</hi> in the most serious, and solemne way that possibly can bee. For my part, I looke upon it, as too great an undervaluing of an ordinance of so great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103490:47"/> to huddle it up in such a <hi>private way</hi> as is the custome now to do. Surely, if any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, be more publick then other, that were the fittest of all to bee taken for this use, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially at such a juncture of time as this.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly,</hi> that by the <hi>prayers of many,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Ordinance may be the more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. So that if a Godly man could present his child to God in this way before a <hi>generall assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> of all the saints over the world, it would bee a thing of lesse <hi>pompe</hi> then <hi>profit</hi> so to do, seeing the more of Gods people agree in any request, the more likely (according to the proportion im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the promise <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19.) is it to succeede.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Partly,</hi> for the more <hi>sol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mne ratification</hi> of that <hi>engagement</hi> which a parent then undertakes on the behalfe of his child The more witnesses there are to the dedication of his child to God, the more conscience of not-fayling afterwards in his education, will any serious man thinke himselfe obliged to make, lest in the mouths of so many witnesses his neglect should bee one day sadly evidenced against him.</p>
               <p>And <hi>partly,</hi> because the <hi>scorne</hi> that is by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers persons publickly cast upon this ordinance, seemes to call for a <hi>Publick Profession</hi> at the hands of those who yet remaine fast-friends thereunto. How great an advantage do wee afford the adversaries, whiles wee give them too much appearing ground to insult, that they have hissed our orthodox principles so farre out of countenance, that very few owne them in a publick practise? Surely, wee can never owne
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:103490:48"/> any truth publiquely in a better season, then when it is most in disgrace.

That it cannot but bee very much prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall in reference to all the advantages before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned to accrew from Infant-Baptisme, and the grounds of it, to set narrower limits to that administration, then the Churches of Christ have used to do in former times, or then the grounds, and foundations upon which it is bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, will allow. For thereby (should such restriction, universally obtaine) abundance of persons would unjustly bee totally deprived of those advantages, by being excluded from the ordinance, at least under that circumstance of administration whence they emerge.

               <p>1. How those that hold a Covenant-Interest to the Children of Christians, from <hi>Abrahams charter,</hi> (as all of Poedobaptists principles do,) will disengage themselves from allowing its full latitude in this particular. If God when hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed it by Christ, and enlarged it to Gentiles as well as Jewes, did pare it, and contract it, so as to exclude a great part of those whom it did formerly include, it will bee necessary that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare under some authentick record of the New Testament, which yet to mee appears not, and if it do not for the future, I suppose these Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries may bee worthy consideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 1. Whether a Jewes or Proselytes child (supposing the immediate parent to have taken up the profession of Christianity, and thereupon to have beene baptized in the <hi>primitive times,</hi> upon that profession, and afterwards to have broken out, and become visibly ungodly) should or might have beene baptized, or no? If so, the cause is yielded: If <hi>not,</hi> I farther enquire, Whether, had hee so broken out whiles hee was yet a <hi>Jew,</hi> or Proselyte to that Church, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his child had beene capable of circumcision or no? If so, then I cannot see but (according to Poedobaptists principles, that owne the same<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:103490:49"/> of the Covenant that is sealed by circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion and baptisme) his right to Baptisme will bee thence undeniably concluded also: If <hi>not,</hi> shew mee one Scripture-rule or example for such an exclusion of the child from circumcision upon the account of the visible ungodlinesse of the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Parents.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 2. Whether, supposing both the <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate parents</hi> bee visibly ungodly, a godly <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father</hi> or <hi>Grand-mother</hi> yet living, may claime this priviledge for their <hi>grand-child,</hi> or no? If so, then it is granted, that the immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents visible ungodlynesse is no such unremovable barre to the childs baptisme: If <hi>not,</hi> I know not (as was before said) how we can hold Infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membership from <hi>Abrahams chart<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> 3. Whether a godly child descending from the loynes of immediate ungodly parents, (sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Hezekiah, or the like) when hee comes to yeares, may not plead the Covenant of his godly Ancestours, upon the account of the promise in the <hi>second commandement?</hi> If hee <hi>may not,</hi> what pedigree is there in the world in which that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of <hi>shewing mercy to thousands of generations of them that love God,</hi> will not bee uselesse once or oftener in every 4th or 5th descent? and if so, surely, in my judgment God would have insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some limitation or <hi>proviso,</hi> to that purpose: If he <hi>may,</hi> I know not why the same promise should not extend to give the church warrant enough to baptize him, whiles an Infant, which
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:103490:49"/> yields him a ground of faith at Age. If any say, that that intercision or cutting off of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Ancestors, in the immediate parents, is resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againe upon his actuall beleeving; I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that personall faith in this case, suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the ground upon which it acts, it being, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it acts; faith doth not create promises, but lay hold on them already made. So that except the Ancestors promise (notwithstanding the pretended intercision by the immediate parents) had still continued in being, &amp; pleadable by faith, the Posterity could not take hold of it by faith, as is supposed.</p>
               <p>Secondly I answer, that till actuall faith, though in the child of an immediate godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, his owne personall unregeneracy makes as great an intercision in the Covenant descending from him, as to his use, (the pleading of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God) as the ungodlynesse of an immediate parent doth in the Covenant of progenitors; for a child of an immediate godly parent, cannot (whiles unregenerate) pleade his Fathers Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, more then the child of an immediate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly parent, can the Covenant of pro-parents or predecessors; and yet this Covenant in the case of immediate parents, (if Godly) confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly takes hold of the child, (though unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate) in point of <hi>Church-membership,</hi> even whiles it is interrupted in point of <hi>Spirituall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and advantage.</hi> It seems therefore that the same should bee granted in the case of pro-parents or predecessors notwithstanding the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:103490:50"/> like interruption. For faith in the child makes no otherwise a restauration of the immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents Covenant, then that of the remote pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; the right to both, (as farre as it depends upon actuall faith in the posterity) being the same. So that the suspending of the Covenant of pro-parents, till actuall faith in the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>child, or great grand-child, gives the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist but too much ground to plead the like sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pension of the Covenant of immediate parents till actuall faith in the immediate Issue.</p>
               <p>2. Herein also it may bee considered how, or upon what account any person, once admitted a member of the Church visible, can bee denyed the privilege of a member, (except as farre as such a privilege requires personall and actuall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions to render him capable of present pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session, which is the cause that divers such are not, though members, admitted to the Lords supper) except hee bee actually excommunicated? Now the privilege of having his children admitted to Baptisme doth not require any such perfonall actuall qualification in the parent, as the Lords supper doth. It is no where said, <hi>Let the parent examine himselfe,</hi> and so let his child be admitted to Baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n; or let him <hi>be able to discern the Lords body,</hi> &amp;c. and so let him present his child to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, nor any thing like it any where, in Scripture.</p>
               <p>Nay even in case of excommunication of both the immediate parents, there is much said in most protestant Divines, that have studyed these cases, why the punishment of the parent should not bee extended to the child, seeing
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:103490:50"/> the offence being but personall, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment but personall (for no Church excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates father and child) and that not totally destroying the persons membership; it seemes unequall that the parents personall crime and punishment should prejudice the child in any sort, much lesse deprive him of that which hee is not cut off from, his Church-membership.</p>
               <p>I onely propound these things to your conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by way of corollary from our prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding discourse. If you desire to see this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion more fully stated (and I judge satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily) I referre to Mr. <hi>Daniell Cawdreyes Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribe,</hi> at the end of a dispute betweene him, and Mr <hi>Cotton,</hi> and <hi>Hooker,</hi> called <hi>[The inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency of the Independent way with Scripture, and it selfe.]</hi> Mr. <hi>Thomas Blakes Vindiciae foederis,</hi> for divers sheets toward the end: and the same Mr. <hi>Blakes Covenant sealed</hi> Chap. 7. sect. 8.</p>
               <p>For my part, my intention is not to enter the lists with any one, the world being too full of disputes already. My maine designe in these discourses, hath beene, to perswade such a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude in the use of Infant baptisme as may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the visibility of Christian profession more large; and yet withall render the sanctifyed use of it more common then it is, among those, who for want of understanding it, and practising accordingly are rendred most obnoxious to tentations of Apostatizing from it. To both which ends, the Lord blesse it, to you and all whom it doth concerne: which I shall the more hope hee will, if you, and they joyne their prayers
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:103490:51"/> with mine to that purpose.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Thought it needfull to advertise thee, that the entertainment the <hi>former part of this dialogue</hi> hath received from <hi>sober heads, &amp; pious hearts,</hi> (and some of them (as I am credibly informed) heretofore dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters in the Doctrine and practise therein plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded) hath been somewhat beyond my expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:103490:52"/> so that I have been thereby (as well as by the desire of my <hi>Stationer)</hi> encouraged to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten this <hi>Second Impression</hi> thereof. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which, I delayed it the longer, that I might receive some private letters from some <hi>reverend men</hi> whose judgment I was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take along with mee, and whose assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance I much desired to render it more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate: and also, that I might see, whether (during that while of my delay) any thing would bee offered by any <hi>dissenter,</hi> that would require my farther animadversions thereupon. And I humbly thanke my learned and godly friends, to whom I made my applications, for the assistance which I have received from them, whether by way of concurrence with, or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent from mee; acknowledging that I am much obliged to them for their Christian opennesse and candour testified in those intimations pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately vouchsafed mee. And in testimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I have laboured, in this <hi>second part</hi> (a great measure whereof hath been occasioned by the hints suggested from them) to manifest no lesse candour in the handling of those particulars so intimated, whether in the points <hi>agreed,</hi> or <hi>controverted</hi> betweene us.</p>
            <p>And I hope, if yet any of their judgments shall not jumpe with mine, eyther as to matter or language; that (neverthelesse) they will candidly accept of my endeavours, to satisfie them, in declaring the grounds of mine owne. But if it should prove otherwise, however, I must intreate them to gratifie my utter averse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:103490:52"/> to publique contests, by a private agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the differences that yet remaine, rather, then to enforce mee unto any disputes from the presse, wherein I dayly observe how difficult a a matter it is to manage a friendly and candid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of differences, in a way becoming Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian moderation.</p>
            <p>And to engage them thereunto, I have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely concealed the names of most of those, with whom I have had to do in this friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourse of private letters, that they may not conclude <hi>themselves</hi> in any sort challenged to appeare that way; And I promise that if I bee yet called upon for <hi>another review</hi> of these Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tises, I shall do my best, eyther by qualifying, explaining, or retracting, what shall yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine offensive to any sober, and judicious friends, (upon like notice given mee, from any of that character) to endeavour their far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And the same course should I have been wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have taken with the * <hi>Author of a late</hi>

How often (Reader) doe I there
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:103490:53"/> expressely confine my assertions concerning [the <hi>spreading,</hi> and <hi>rivetting</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> in a <hi>nation, by Infant-Baptisme]</hi> to the <hi>Church visible,</hi> and the <hi>profession of Religion</hi> in a nation, and <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible believers!</hi> Nay the very next <hi>Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion</hi> moved thereupon, and the <hi>Answer</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, clearly proceed upon the supposition of that sense.</p>
            <p>And yet <hi>this Author,</hi> will (in despight of mine owne cleare expressions, and the whole scope of the discourse) perswade <hi>mee</hi> and his <hi>reader,</hi> that by <hi>[rivetting the profession of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion into the body of a Nation,]</hi> I meane the <hi>[rivetting of Religion in the soules &amp; spirits of men]</hi> (for so, he tells us expressely, that hee and his confederates, who, it seemes, know my meaning better then my felfe, understand it) and (answerably) that by the <hi>[leavening of Nations,</hi> in the same way] I meane, <hi>[lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening them with grace:]</hi> or else I know not what hee means by opposing the work of <hi>Infant-Baptisme,</hi> and the <hi>spirit of life and glory,</hi> in relation to this <hi>leavening worke,</hi> in the same place.</p>
            <p>And upon these <hi>grosse mistakes,</hi> hee spends a great deale of <hi>waste paper,</hi> to informe his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that Infant-Baptisme is not Christs way to <hi>disciple,</hi> (i. e. <hi>savingly to convert) nations;</hi> and that hee must not make that <hi>sacrament an Idoll,</hi> and <hi>expect the work of grace</hi> to <hi>be wrought upon the soule, by the sprinkling of water upon the body:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pag. 19 21.</note> and all this <hi>(quis crederet?)</hi> out of a great <hi>feare</hi> (as hee professeth) lest somebody (of

            <p>Thus <hi>Reader,</hi> thou mayst see how little I am concerned, to answer <hi>this Author</hi> in this mater: seeing hee proceeds upon a sense given to my words (according to his owne confession) <hi>quite contrary to my scope, and intention.</hi> And yet there remaines another sad reckoning, which hee threatens mee withall (in the same place) to call mee unto again concerning <hi>this, and two or three other passages towards the end of that booke</hi> of mine, in a <hi>sixth Treatise</hi> of his, which I have not seene; and the presse cannot now stay for my enquiry after and examination thereof, (it having beene delayd some weekes already, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:103490:54"/> my expectation of <hi>this part,</hi> which I have now taken notice of, from my <hi>Stationer,</hi> to whom I sent to procure it) or if it could, I know not by what name to send for it, (having by mee no catalogue of this Authors workes to direct mee) and therefore can say nothing to it at this Time. And indeed if it bee no more <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning</hi> to mee, then this already mentioned, I promise thee, I never shall thinke it worth thy trouble or mine to take any notice of it at any Time. However, I <hi>forgive him this worng;</hi> considering, that his exceeding passionate zeale against any thing that in his judgment tended to the supporting of a <hi>Nationall Church,</hi> (which is the abomination of abominations to his soule; and all one, (as his expression, but now quoted hath it) with a <hi>Popish,</hi> and <hi>Malignant Church,</hi> (hath made him so angry, that hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (in that humour) but fall out with any one hee meets, not duely enquiring whether they bee friends or foes; or whether there bee any just cause, to quarrell with them or no: and I resolve (as farre as I know mine owne mind) never to enter the lists of a publique dispute with a man of that temper. To shut up all, I shall only crave leave to offer a little advice to my <hi>Reverend Brother,</hi> whom I beleeve to be a godly man, and know to bee Zealous in his principles (perhaps too much) that hee do not engage himselfe too hotly in clashings, and contests with his neighbour-Ministers and others, about such things, as they are perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the <hi>Kingdome of God doth not consist in,</hi>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:103490:55"/> lest hee lose the quiet of his owne spirit, and the comfort and help of his fellow-labourers gifts, together with the affections of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractory people, who (as I know by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,) being dealt with over-rigorously in such things by ministers, will bee too much exasperated, to bee capable of receiving any thing from them without prejudice: In summe, that hee do not thinke, the bespatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his neighbour-Ministers, and their principles, actions, congregations, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, a regular way to increase his owne separated fellowship. And having so <hi>done,</hi> I have <hi>done with him,</hi> for this time: and shall with thee too, when I have▪ (in a word) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed thee; that (because the variety of new matter which offered it selfe to my se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond thoughts, grew quickly to such a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity as would have made too great an alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in the <hi>renewed impression,</hi> of my <hi>Booke formerly published,</hi> even so much as to make it uselesse to those who had layd out their money upon it before, and so necessitate them to buy it againe, if I should have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted it therein;) I thought it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient (contrary to my intentions when I published the <hi>Epistle</hi> prefixed thereunto) to let the <hi>First Booke</hi> come forth againe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration (except in few words) and subjoyne the additions in a distinct Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise by themselves, which, as I now put into thy hands, so I hope, God will give thee grace to make a profitable use of, to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:103490:55"/> his owne glory▪ the turning <hi>vaine janglings about Infant-Baptisme,</hi> into a <hi>practicall improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, and (therein) the benefit <hi>of thine own soule.</hi>
